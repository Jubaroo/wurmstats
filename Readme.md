Wurm Stats
==========
A utility to assist with reading and formatting the `stats.xml` file generated by the Wurm server.

Structure
---------
* html/ - Publicly visible folder
    * stats.html - Contains the HTML to include or link to for stats.
    * js/ - Javascript folder
        * stats.js - The main program that reads in and outputs the stats.xml data
    * css/ - CSS folder (generated by sass)
        * stats.css - The actual stylesheet, generated by sass (but may be modified)
* php/ - PHP for servers that support it
    * stats.php - A wrapper for users who need cross-domain or are unable to host stats.xml in a publicly accessible manner
* scss/ - Sass source files for generating CSS
    * stats.scss - The stats.css source file

Configuration
-------------

## PHP
If you choose to use the PHP wrapper, you must host it on a server that supports PHP.
To set it up, open the `stats.php` file and edit `$pathToStats` to point to your `stats.xml` file.
Example:
```
$pathToStats = "/home/jonathan/stats.xml";
```
You may also specify a URL:
```
$pathToStats = "http://brain.death.rocks/~jonathan/stats.xml";
```
If the server is unable to read the path, then it will return an HTTP 500 error.
